title: Machine Learning approaches to estimating and comparing models of
  intertemporal choice
abstract: Subjective value has long been measured using binary choice
  experiments to assess individual differences in intertemporal preferences.
  Dynamic, stochastic models of choice permit meaningful inferences about
  cognition from process-level data, explaining value in terms of underlying
  mechanisms in a way that simpler, static models cannot. However, the usability
  of complex generative models is severely limited by the technical difficulty
  of model fitting and model comparison steps, along with the computational
  power they require. In this talk, we develop and test an approach that uses
  deep neural networks to estimate the parameters of three behavioral models and
  perform model comparison between the three to assess their ability to better
  account for intertemporal choice. The models we explore differ in their
  complexity and the theoretical assumptions they make when it comes to the
  study of preference; the traditional and static hyperbolic discount and
  hyperboloid functions compared with a probabilistic attribute-wise model
  constructed by direct and relative differences in delay and payoff. Once
  trained, the neural networks allow for accurate and instantaneous parameter
  estimation and model comparison, as opposed to traditional methods that can
  take several hours and in some cases days. We compare different network
  architectures and show that they are able to accurately recover true
  intertemporal preferences related to each model's parameters, and then compare
  each model's performance in their ability to predict individual choice. The
  models were applied to a large data set of substance users in protracted
  abstinence from Sofia, Bulgaria who completed a short, 27-question choice
  task. The results illustrate the utility of machine-learning approaches for
  wider adoption and integration of cognitive and economic models, providing
  efficient methods for quantifying meaningful differences in intertemporal
  preferences from simple experiments.
