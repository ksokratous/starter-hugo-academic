abstract: 'The Implicit Association Test (IAT), like many behavioral measures, seeks
  to quantify meaningful individual differences in cognitive processes that are difficult
  to assess with approaches like self-reports. However, much like other behavioral
  measures, many IATs appear to show low test-retest reliability and typical scoring
  methods fail to quantify all of the decision-making processes that generate the
  overt task performance. Here, we develop a new modeling approach for IATs based
  on the geometric similarity representation (GSR) model. This model leverages both
  response times and accuracy on IATs to make inferences about representational similarity
  between the stimuli and categories. The model disentangles processes related to
  response caution, stimulus encoding, similarities between concepts and categories,
  and response processes unrelated to the choice itself. This approach to analyzing
  IAT data illustrates that the unreliability in IATs is almost entirely attributable
  to the methods used to analyze data from the task: GSR model parameters show test-retest
  reliability around .80-.90, on par with reliable self-report measures. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate how model parameters result in greater validity compared to the IAT
  D-score, Quad model, and simple diffusion model contrasts, predicting outcomes related
  to intergroup contact and motivation. Finally, we present a simple point-and-click
  software tool for fitting the model, which uses a pre-trained neural network to
  estimate best-fit parameters of the GSR model. This approach allows easy and instantaneous
  fitting of IAT data with minimal demands on coding or technical expertise on the
  part of the user, making the new model accessible and effective.'
