abstract: Subjective value has long been measured using binary choice experiments,
  yet responses like willingness-to-pay prices can be an effective and efficient way
  to assess individual differences risk preferences and value. Tony Marley’s work
  illustrated that dynamic, stochastic models permit meaningful inferences about cognition
  from process-level data on paradigms beyond binary choice, yet many of these models
  remain difficult to use because their likelihoods must be approximated from simulation.
  In this paper, we develop and test an approach that uses deep neural networks to
  estimate the parameters of otherwise-intractable behavioral models. Once trained,
  these networks allow for accurate and instantaneous parameter estimation. We compare
  different network architectures and show that they accurately recover true risk
  preferences related to utility, response caution, anchoring, and non-decision processes.
  To illustrate the usefulness of the approach, it was then applied to estimate model
  parameters for a large, demographically representative sample of U.S. participants
  who completed a 20-question pricing task — an estimation task that is not feasible
  with previous methods. The results illustrate the utility of machine-learning approaches
  for fitting cognitive and economic models, providing efficient methods for quantifying
  meaningful differences in risk preferences from sparse data.
