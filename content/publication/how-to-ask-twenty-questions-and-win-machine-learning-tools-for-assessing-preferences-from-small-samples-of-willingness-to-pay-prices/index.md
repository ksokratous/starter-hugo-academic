abstract: Subjective value has long been measured using binary choice
  experiments, yet responses like willingness-to-pay prices can be an effective
  and efficient way to assess individual differences risk preferences and value.
  Tony Marley’s work illustrated that dynamic, stochastic models permit
  meaningful inferences about cognition from process-level data on paradigms
  beyond binary choice, yet many of these models remain difficult to use because
  their likelihoods must be approximated from simulation. In this paper, we
  develop and test an approach that uses deep neural networks to estimate the
  parameters of otherwise-intractable behavioral models. Once trained, these
  networks allow for accurate and instantaneous parameter estimation. We compare
  different network architectures and show that they accurately recover true
  risk preferences related to utility, response caution, anchoring, and
  non-decision processes. To illustrate the usefulness of the approach, it was
  then applied to estimate model parameters for a large, demographically
  representative sample of U.S. participants who completed a 20-question pricing
  task — an estimation task that is not feasible with previous methods. The
  results illustrate the utility of machine-learning approaches for fitting
  cognitive and economic models, providing efficient methods for quantifying
  meaningful differences in risk preferences from sparse data.
